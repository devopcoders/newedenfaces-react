# Awesome tutorial by Sahat Yalkabov
### In this tutorial we are going to build a character voting app (inspired by Facemash) for EVE Online - a massively multiplayer online game. You will learn how to build a REST API with Node.js, save and retrieve data from MongoDB, track online visitors in real-time using Socket.IO, build a single-page app experience using React + Flux with server-side rendering and then finally deploy it to the cloud.
